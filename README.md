## About the Ecosystem

The Qiskit Ecosystem is a collection of software and tutorials that builds on
or extends Qiskit. The goal of the Ecosystem is to celebrate, support, and
accelerate development of quantum technologies using Qiskit. View all projects
at [qiskit.org/ecosystem](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem).

This repository manages members of the ecosystem, and can run regular tests on
each project to alert maintainers of upcoming breaking changes.


## How to join

1. **Upload your project to GitHub**

2. **Add tests (optional)**
   
   If you use [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/4.6.4/) tests to check your code, we
   can run your tests regularly to detect breaking changes in current and
   upcoming versions of Qiskit.

3. **Open a project submission issue**
   
   Once you're ready, [make an
   issue](https://github.com/qiskit-community/ecosystem/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=&projects=&template=submission.yml&title=%5BSubmission%5D%3A+)
   asking to add your project to the Ecosystem. This will automatically create
   a pull request adding your project to the repo. We'll review the pull request
   and get back to you within a few days.


## How to update project information

To change your project's information, find your project's file in
[`.ecosystem/resources/members`](https://github.com/qiskit-community/ecosystem/tree/main/ecosystem/resources/members)
and make a pull request with the updated information. You can also [make an
issue](https://github.com/qiskit-community/ecosystem/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=update+request&projects=&template=update.yml&title=%5BProject+update%5D%3A+)
asking us to do it, or asking us to remove your project from the Ecosystem.
