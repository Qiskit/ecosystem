## About the ecosystem

The Qiskit ecosystem is a collection of software and tutorials that builds on
or extends Qiskit. The goal of the Ecosystem is to celebrate, support, and
accelerate development of quantum technologies using Qiskit. View all projects
at [qiskit.github.io/ecosystem/](https://qiskit.github.io/ecosystem/).

This repository handles submissions to the ecosystem and builds the web page.
