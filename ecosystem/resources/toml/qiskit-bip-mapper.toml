description = "The repository contains a standalone routing stage plugin to use the BIPMapping [routing](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/transpiler.html#routing-stage) pass. The BIP mapping pass solves the routing and [layout](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/transpiler.html#layout-stage) problems as a binary integer programming (BIP) problem. The algorithm used in this pass is described in: G. Nannicini et al. \"Optimal qubit assignment and routing via integer programming.\" [arXiv:2106.06446](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06446)"
