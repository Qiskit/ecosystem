alternatives = "There are some alternatives to individual modules within the qBraid-SDK e.g. to execute a Qiskit circuit on an AWS device, you could use the qiskit-braket-provider. However, there aren't any other existing projects that support the same matrix of quantum program types and backends through a single, unified interface."
