alternatives = "yeah there is a lot of alternative projects! pennylane by xanadu, openfermion by google and special one qiskit-nature by ibm, and yes, I was inspired by qiskit-nature to develop it! but all these modules have limitations and one of them is you can just work on matter. I am coming up with brand new module which is specially made for working on antimatter."
affiliations = "Since I have worked independently so no organization is affiliated to the project, Even I am not an official student of any institute, So I dont have any choice but I am desirate to associate it with IBM or Cern, because work is associated to them."
