alternatives = "tVHA is an improved ansatz which shows better performance for NISQ devices than UCCSD from `qiskit-nature` (see paper [Truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz: efficient quantum circuit design for quantum chemistry and material science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19772)). It can work as a replacement for ansatz efficientSU2 from package `qiskit` though with its own pros and cons. Classiq has its own basic implementation of VHA ([Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/user-guide/applications/ground-state-solving/ansatzes/hva/)) but with fewer options and without any truncation scheme."
