url = "https://github.com/QuantumApplicationLab/vqls-prototype"
description = "The Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) uses an optimization approach to solve linear systems of equations. The vqls-prototype allows to easily setup and deploy a VQLS instance on different backends through the use of qiskit primitives and the runtime library."
