description = "Spinoza is a quantum state simulator (implemented in Rust) that is one of the fastest open-source simulators. Spinoza is implemented using a functional approach. Additionally, Spinoza has a `QuantumCircuit` object-oriented interface, which partially matches Qiskit's interface. Spinoza is capable of running in a myriad of computing environments (e.g., small workstations), and on various architectures. At this juncture, Spinoza only utilizes a single thread; however, it is designed to be easily extended into a parallel version, as well as a distributed version. The paper associated with Spinoza is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01493.pdf)."
